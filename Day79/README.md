# Day79 Analysing the Nobel Prize with Plotly, Matplotlib & Seaborn

Today you'll learn:

Create a Choropleth to display data on a map.

Create bar charts showing different segments of the data with plotly.

Create Sunburst charts with plotly.

Use Seaborn's .lmplot() and show best-fit lines across multiple categories using the row, hue, and lowess parameters.

Understand how a different picture emerges when looking at the same data in different ways (e.g., box plots vs a time series analysis).

See the distribution of our data and visualise descriptive statistics with the help of a histogram in Seaborn.
